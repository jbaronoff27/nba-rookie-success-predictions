# nba-rookie-success-predictions
Logistic regression model predicting NBA rookie success from 20 years of college basketball stats. I made this project last year in Ms. Jergen's Data Analysis class. I am most proud of this because it is related to a topic I am very passionate about (basketball) and it is able to predict the success of rookies with a 67% success rate.
